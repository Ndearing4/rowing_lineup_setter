  # --- Scoring Weights for Single Boat Optimization ---
  # These values control the importance of different factors in the cost function.
  # Higher values mean that the factor has a greater influence on the final lineup.

  # Penalty for a rower being on their non-preferred side (port/starboard).
  side_preference_penalty: 1000.0

  # Penalty for having a mix of varsity and novice rowers in the same boat.
  # This helps to create more uniform boats in terms of experience.
  experience_mixing_penalty: 1000.0

  # Penalty for variance in fitness scores within a boat.
  # A higher value will favor boats with more evenly matched rowers.
  power_variance_penalty: 0.1

  # Penalty for having a stronger rower (lower fitness score) placed behind a weaker one.
  # This encourages a "stern-loaded" lineup where power is applied progressively.
  stern_loading_penalty: 60.0

multi_boat:
  # --- Scoring Weights for Multi-Boat Optimization ---

  # Penalty for a rower being on their non-preferred side (port/starboard).
  side_preference_penalty: 100.0

  # Penalty for having a mix of varsity and novice rowers in the same boat.
  # This is often higher in multi-boat mode to encourage homogenous boats.
  experience_mixing_penalty: 1000.0

  # Penalty for variance in average fitness scores between boats.
  # A higher value will favor creating boats that are more evenly matched in terms of overall power.
